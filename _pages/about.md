Hi there, welcome to my personal website! My name is Onur Kele&#351 [o&#712;nur&#805; ke&#712;le&#643;]. I am a senior in the [Department of Foreign Language Education](https://fled.boun.edu.tr) at [Bo&#287;azi&ccedil;i University](http://www.boun.edu.tr), Istanbul, Turkey. My main research interests include sign language linguistics, (atypical) language development, sentential processing, and computational linguistics.

Research
======
I am currently affiliated with the [Psycholinguistics Research Laboratory](http://denizlab.boun.edu.tr) led by Dr. Nazik Deniz Din&ccedil;topal. In the lab, I am working on a project that examines how individuals on the autism spectrum process sentences and integrate real world knowledge. I am also volunteering for another project that investigates the processing of negative polarity items (NPIs) in Turkish. Previously I worked as undergraduate research assistant in the [Sign Language Lab](https://linguistics.boun.edu.tr/sign-language-lab) located at the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.boun.edu.tr). Under the supervision of Dr. Kadir G&ouml;kg&ouml;z, I led two research projects where I explored the cognitive and linguistic effects of linguistic deprivation on the narrative abilities and verbal fluency of deaf individuals who use [Turkish Sign Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Sign_Language). My other academic interests cover cognitive modeling and computational analyses of natural languages. 

Teaching
======
Professionally, I have been teaching English as a foreign language to both university-level and K12 learners in different institutions. I am currently a student teacher at [Robert College](https://www.robcol.k12.tr) where I plan and teach lessons to 9th grade students. I am also one of the co-founders of the educational platform [FluentKid](fluentkid.com). My teaching philosophy include the integration of Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) and Task Based Language Teaching (TBLT). Please view my educational portfolio [page](https://kelesonur.com/portfolio/) to see sample lesson plans and materials. On this [page](https://kelesonur.com/year-archive/), I share my personal reflections concerning meaningful learning and technology incorporated classrooms.
