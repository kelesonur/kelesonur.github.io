Hi there! My name is Onur Keles. I am a senior in the [Department of Foreign Language Education](https://fled.boun.edu.tr) at [Bogazici University](http://www.boun.edu.tr), Istanbul, Turkey. My main research interests include sign language linguistics, deaf education, language acquisition, sentential processing, and computational linguistics.

Research
------
I am currently affiliated with the [Psycholinguistics Research Laboratory](http://denizlab.boun.edu.tr) run by Dr. Nazik Deniz Dinçtopal. I am working on a research project that examines how individuals on the Autism spectrum process sentences that require real world knowledge integration. I am also volunteering in another project that investigates the processing of Negative Polarity Items (NPI) items in Turkish. Previously I worked as an undergraduate research assistant in the [Sign Language Lab](https://linguistics.boun.edu.tr/sign-language-lab) in the [Deparment of Linguistics](https://linguistics.boun.edu.tr). Under the supervision of Dr. Kadir Gökgöz, I led two research projects, both of which aimed to uncover the linguistic and cognitive effects of language deprivation on deaf individuals' narrative abilities and verbal fluency. 


Teaching 
------
Professionally, I have been teaching English as a Foreign Language to both university-level and K12 learners. For the past year, I have been working as a student-teacher at [Robert College](https://website.robcol.k12.tr/en/home-page), Istanbul, Turkey. I am also one of the co-founders of the educational platform [FluentKid](fluentkid.com). My teaching philosophy is shaped by the  integration of Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) and Task Based Language Teaching (TBLT). Check out my professional portfolio [page](http://kelesonur.com/portfolio/) to find the instructional materials and lesson plans I prepared. Also on this [page](http://kelesonur.com/year-archive/), you may find some personal reflections concerning meaningful learning and technology incorporated classrooms.
