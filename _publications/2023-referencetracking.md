We investigated the reference tracking strategies among deaf adults with signing deaf parents (DoD) and adult deaf signers with non-signing hearing parents or caregivers (DoH) who had late exposure to Turkish Sign Language. We concluded that DoH signers are still able to achieve native-like competency in terms of reference tracking in simple narratives but DoD signers utilize the spatial affordances of the visual-spatial modality better than DoH signers only to a certain extent.
